# AutoFind - Simplifying Car Choices

## Overview

The Car Decision Analytics Dashboard is a Python-based project developed using Streamlit. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training with decision trees. The dashboard allows users to visualize decision tree structures, assess model accuracy, and explore dataset characteristics through insightful plots.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure data consistency and handle missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into dataset characteristics.
- **Decision Tree Model Training:** Utilize decision trees for car decision prediction.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive charts and graphs for enhanced understanding.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Employ k-fold cross-validation and Random Forest.
- **Privacy-Preserving PATE Algorithm:** Ensure data privacy during model training.
